  # You may be asking, "Why not just include all these os options in the strategy section of a single build job?
  # WELL, I kept getting timeout errors when I did that because it would try to run them concurrently. So instead I just
  # made a separate job for each and specified in the 'needs' property that the previous build needs to complete before
  # the current one is started. Except in the first, that just 'needs' the createrelease job to finish.
